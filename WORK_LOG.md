| Sep 24 | 11:20-11:40am | I thought this would be pretty easy with a set. In terms of algorithm I added the dictionary into a set (which is average O(1) lookup time) and made a second set to store the misspelled words already in my array. Then, if a word in my text isn't in the dictionary set or the misspelled words set, I add it to the array. In the end I return the array and get the right answer. This approach is definitely pretty heavy handed (although it does work) and I will try to find a different way to do it without a hashset. Then, I optimized the runtime a little bit by using an Array instead of Arraylist to keep track of the answer array. |

I'm still not sure how I'm going to implement my search function (how do you tell if something is a passing letter or just not a node?). I just finished everything in starting my classes up except for my insert and search functions. |

I got the trie to work for tests Sentence and Poem but not for the other ones. I think there's still some corner case I'm missing so I'll look for it in the coming days. I've tried finding these edge cases with apostrophe/hyphens, but it still doesn't change anything. I also need to find a better way to debug because the debugger won't show the trie very nicely. |

This accounts for random characters in the texts which aren't A-Z. |

How my thinking shifted through the hourish: I started with labelling the letters on each of the children, so I added a char[] to keep track of them. I then realized that I only had to keep track of the char in the position I was at, not the children, because at a given position, I'm comparing to the char at that position, not any one in the children array. I eventually got it to work, but I don't think it works very well because the runtime didn't go down much from my trie implementation. |

I also changed my TSTNode and Node classes to be more code fluent by making the variables private and set() and get() functions for each variable. |
